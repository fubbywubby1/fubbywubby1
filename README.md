Salutations!
As a student, I have had a wide range of opportunities to engage in specific fields of computer science, data science and math.
I have a particular fondness for AI, as in, I enjoy learning of the process of developing AIs, how they function, and the actual mathetatical processese behind them.
I aspire to someday work as an AI developer, but I of course share interests in fields like software development and data analysis. I also share a particular fondness for
any form of analytics in regards to finance.

I am proficient in Java, Python, R, C++, Linux Command Prompts, Windows Command Prompts and Excel
I have an aptitude for critical thinking and problem-solving.
I am also a leader and collaborator, I excel at managing time for teams (and myself) and being a strong leader.
I am incredibly analytical and remain very attentive to small details.

In regards to projects, I have the following:

Day-Trading AI
(Individual project with a friend)
This project is oriented towards an AI that analyzes S&P 500 funds and analyzes them to attempt to trade them
It is coded in Python
It required strong knowledge of the AI creation process, the statistical methods behind AI, and acute awareness towards training the AI
It is currently still being tested on test data but will soon move to being a simulator-like state until the results for it seem strong enough to warrant actual day-trading using it

Project to Design Schedule Application
Completed in my Honors Object-Oriented Programming class
We worked in a team of 5 to design a schedule application that recommends mental-health friendly activities to the user depending on their aggregate stress levels and available time
It was coded in Java
The project required intense knowledge of intricate inheritance structures, lambda functions, streaming and the design of interfaces in Java
Developed a UML representation of the complicated project additionally, along with a sequence diagram to help detail data flow

Currently focused on designing more projects to enhance my learning and am open to collaboration for any projects.
Seeking a position in computer science and data science.
